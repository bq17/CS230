    1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    The Gaming Room client wanted to develop a web-based game that was serves multiple platforms based on their current game "Draw It or Lose It". Some of the software requirements desired from the Gaming Room included a game with the ability to have one or more teams involved, each team having multiple players assigned to the team, game and team names being unique to where they can only be used once and the app would verify that information and only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time.

    2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    I believe I followed the directions well and fulfilled all the requirements desired from the Gaming Room. I was also able to provide insightful recommendations in the SDT to help improve the app with the intention of the app growing.

    3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    I thought the SDT helped provide a deeper understanding of what was being developed. Flowcharts only show the code needed to fulfill the requirements needed by the Gaming Room while the SDT was able to help explain "why" those requirements were desired and what was to potentially come of the app and its future development.

    4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    I think I would touch up on the developmental requirements for the server and client side as well with which developmental tools would be most suitable for those requirements. I would try to obtain a deeper understanding of each requirement instead of only researching those requirements at face value. I believe that would also lead to better recommendations for the developmental tools.

    5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    I interpreted the user's needs by myself having an understanding of what it is like to play video games and it helped with implementing their needs within the SDT. Their needs are very important because if their needs are not met, then we would have unhappy users who would not play the game making it an unsuccessful app.

    6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
    Similar to the answer above, I approached it with the mindset of playing games avidly online and understanding what works and what doesn't work. In the future, I hope to have a deeper understanding of what is going on in the back end of development and which tools would be more beneficial for whatever I was developing so I could provide other options throughout development instead of worrying so much about the directions I had to follow.
